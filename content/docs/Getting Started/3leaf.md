### Backend Project overview

## Overview

This document provides an overview of the backend structure and technologies used in the project. The backend is built using modern tools and frameworks to ensure scalability, security, and efficient handling of requests. It uses Express.js as the primary framework for handling HTTP requests, with various supporting libraries for middleware, validation, and security.

## Technologies Used

### Node.js

- **Description**: A JavaScript runtime built on Chrome's V8 engine that allows for building scalable network applications using non-blocking, event-driven architecture.
- **Benefits**:
  - High performance for I/O-heavy operations.
  - Asynchronous programming model, improving scalability.
  - Large ecosystem of open-source libraries via npm.

### Express.js

- **Description**: A minimalist web framework for Node.js used to create server-side applications and APIs.
- **Benefits**:
  - Simplifies routing, middleware, and HTTP request handling.
  - Provides a robust set of features for web and mobile applications.
  - Modular, allowing for integration of additional middleware to handle specific tasks.

### Babel

- **Description**: A JavaScript compiler used to convert modern ES6+ JavaScript code into backward-compatible JavaScript versions that can run in older environments.
- **Benefits**:
  - Allows the use of the latest JavaScript features while ensuring compatibility.
  - Supports ES6 modules, arrow functions, async/await, etc.

### Joi

- **Description**: A validation library for JavaScript objects, ensuring that API request data follows expected structures and formats.
- **Benefits**:
  - Provides a declarative way to define validation schemas.
  - Reduces manual validation logic in routes and controllers.

### Multer

- **Description**: Middleware for handling multipart/form-data, primarily used for file uploads.
- **Benefits**:
  - Simplifies the process of accepting and managing file uploads via HTTP requests.
  - Integrates seamlessly with Express.js.

### Helmet

- **Description**: Middleware that helps secure Express apps by setting various HTTP headers.
- **Benefits**:
  - Helps prevent common security issues like cross-site scripting (XSS), clickjacking, and other web vulnerabilities.
  - Easily configurable to add or remove security headers.

### Cookie Parser & Cookie Session

- **Description**: Used for parsing cookies attached to client requests and managing user sessions securely.
- **Benefits**:
  - Supports handling cookies in HTTP requests and responses.
  - Provides tools to store session data on the client-side using cookies.

### CSURF

- **Description**: Middleware for protecting against cross-site request forgery (CSRF) attacks.
- **Benefits**:
  - Generates CSRF tokens to secure forms and API requests.
  - Enhances security by preventing unauthorized actions on authenticated sessions.

### Day.js

- **Description**: A lightweight date manipulation library used to handle date formatting and manipulation.
- **Benefits**:
  - Small footprint and fast.
  - Provides modern date handling and parsing without large dependencies like Moment.js.

### Dotenv

- **Description**: A module that loads environment variables from a `.env` file into `process.env` in Node.js.
- **Benefits**:
  - Facilitates configuration by storing sensitive keys and configuration values in environment variables.
  - Keeps codebase clean and reduces the risk of hardcoding credentials.

### Body-parser

- **Description**: Middleware used to parse incoming request bodies in a middleware before handlers, available under the `req.body` property.
- **Benefits**:
  - Supports different content types like JSON and URL-encoded forms.
  - Essential for processing POST and PUT request bodies.

### CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing)

- **Description**: A middleware for enabling cross-origin requests.
- **Benefits**:
  - Enables sharing of resources between different domains, useful for APIs consumed by clients on different origins.
  - Configurable to restrict or allow access from certain domains.

### Crypto

- **Description**: A built-in Node.js module used for implementing cryptographic functionality like encryption, decryption, and hashing.
- **Benefits**:
  - Provides tools for securely encrypting sensitive data, such as passwords and tokens.
  - Ensures data integrity with hashing functions.

## Project Structure Overview

The project is organized in a way to maintain separation of concerns and keep the codebase modular and maintainable. Here's a breakdown of key directories:

- **`app/`**: Contains the main entry points for the backend logic. Files such as `index.js` and `server.js` initialize the application and configure the server.

- **`Config/`**: This folder holds environment-specific configuration files (e.g., `global.js`, `local.js`) that handle different environments like development, production, etc.

- **`Constants/`**: Contains constants and error message files. This ensures that error codes and constants are reusable across the application.

- **`Controllers/`**: Manages the logic for handling different API requests. Controllers are responsible for interacting with services and responding to API requests.

- **`Middlewares/`**: Houses middleware functions that execute before the final route handler, such as `jwtVerification.js` for verifying JWT tokens and handling authentication.

- **`Routes/`**: Defines the application's routes. Each file corresponds to a different set of API routes (e.g., `test.js` handles routes for testing purposes).

- **`Services/`**: Contains business logic and acts as a bridge between the controller and data access layers, such as `mongoService.js` for database interactions.

- **`Utils/`**: Holds utility functions that can be reused throughout the application, such as `commonFunctions.js`, `crypt.js` for encryption, and `logger.js` for logging.

- **`Validations/`**: Handles input validation using libraries like `Joi`. These ensure that incoming data adheres to the expected format before passing to the controller logic.

## Scripts and Commands

### Start the Application

To start the application, use the following command:
```bash
npm run start
```
This uses `babel-node` to transpile ES6+ code on the fly.

### Development Mode

To run the application in development mode with auto-reload (via `nodemon`), use:
```bash
npm run dev
```
The `NODE_ENV=dev` is set to enable specific configurations for development purposes.

### Build and Serve the Application

To build the project for production, run:
```bash
npm run build
```
This command transpiles the code and outputs it to the `dist/` directory. You can then serve the built application using:
```bash
npm run serve
```
This serves the files from the `dist/` folder.

## Environment Variables

- **`.env`**: This file stores sensitive configuration values (e.g., API keys, database URIs) in a secure manner. Use the `dotenv` package to load these variables into the application.

Example `.env` file:
```
PORT=8080
NODE_ENV=dev
DB_URI=mongodb://localhost:27017/test_db
JWT_SECRET=supersecretkey
```

## Security Considerations

- **Helmet** is used to set security headers to mitigate common vulnerabilities.
- **CSURF** protects against CSRF attacks.
- **Cookie-session** and **JWT verification** ensure secure session management and authentication.

## Conclusion

The backend of project is designed with security, scalability, and maintainability in mind. By leveraging modern Node.js frameworks and libraries such as Express, Joi, Helmet, and others, the backend provides a solid foundation for handling HTTP requests, managing user sessions, and securely validating incoming data.
