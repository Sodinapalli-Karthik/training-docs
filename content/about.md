# **High-Resolution Video Editing Platform with Real-Time Previews**

## **Overview**

This document outlines the architecture and processes for developing a high-resolution video editing platform. The platform allows users to upload, edit, and preview videos in real time, leveraging Nuxt for the front end, Go for the back end, and AWS for cloud services.

## **Architecture Overview**

### **Frontend**

* **Framework**: Nuxt.js with Server-Side Rendering (SSR)  
* **Communication**: WebSockets for real-time updates, REST API for other interactions  
* **Video Player**: HTML5 video player with HLS.js for streaming previews

### **Backend**

* **Language**: Go  
* **Framework**: Custom microservices in Go  
* **Communication**: gRPC for internal microservice communication, WebSockets, and REST API for frontend interaction  
* **Video Processing**: FFmpeg for video segmentation and processing

### **Cloud Services**

* **Storage**: AWS S3 for storing raw and processed videos  
* **Compute**: AWS Lambda for serverless functions (optional), EC2 for scalable compute instances  
* **Database**: AWS DynamoDB or RDS for storing metadata and project details

## **Detailed Process**

### **1\. Video Upload and Initial Processing**

#### **1.1 Upload Files**

* **Frontend**: Users upload video files via the Nuxt.js frontend.  
* **Backend**: Uploaded files are transferred to a designated S3 bucket for initial processing.

#### **1.2 Metadata Extraction**

* **Backend**: Extract FFmpeg metadata (e.g., duration, resolution) from the uploaded video.  
* **Store Metadata**: Save metadata in a database for future reference.

### **2\. Real-Time Video Editing**

#### **2.1 Metadata Transmission**

* **Frontend**: Fetch and display video metadata for the user to start editing.  
* **Backend**: Serve metadata to the frontend via REST API.

#### **2.2 Timeline Management**

* **Frontend**: Users create and manage timelines, dragging and dropping video segments.  
* **Backend**: Transmit timeline changes and segment details via WebSockets.

### **3\. Generating High-Resolution Previews**

#### **3.1 Segment-Based Streaming**

* **Segment Videos**: Use FFmpeg to split videos into smaller segments.  
* **Create Playlist**: Generate an HLS playlist (playlist.m3u8) to manage video segments.

**FFmpeg Command Example:**

CSS

`ffmpeg -i input.mp4 -c:v libx264 -c:a aac -f hls -hls_time 10 -hls_list_size 0 -hls_segment_filename 'segment_%03d.ts' playlist.m3u8`

#### **3.2 Serve Segments**

* **Backend**: Host video segments and playlists via Go-based microservices or directly from S3.  
* **Frontend**: Integrate an HLS-compatible video player (e.g., HLS.js) to stream the segments.

### **4\. Real-Time Updates**

#### **4.1 WebSocket Integration**

* **Backend**: Use WebSockets to push real-time updates to the frontend.  
* **Frontend**: Update the video player and timeline in real-time as edits are made.

### **5\. Final Rendering and Storage**

#### **5.1 Final Video Processing**

* **Backend**: Once editing is complete, process the video in full resolution.  
* **Store Final Video**: Save the final video in S3 and update the frontend with the final URL.

### **6\. Saving and Loading Projects**

#### **6.1 Save Project**

* **Backend**: Save the timeline and metadata as JSON in the database.  
* **Frontend**: Allow users to save their current state and load it later.

#### **6.2 Load Project**

* **Backend**: Retrieve project details from the database.  
* **Frontend**: Load project state and initialize the editor with the saved data.

## **Summary**

By following this architecture, the platform can provide high-resolution video previews in real-time without significant delays. The backend processes the video segments and streams them to the frontend, allowing users to see their edits immediately. This architecture ensures efficient processing and scalability, leveraging the power of AWS for storage and compute needs.

### **Technologies Used**

* **Frontend**: Nuxt.js, WebSockets, HTML5 Video Player with HLS.js  
* **Backend**: Go, gRPC, WebSockets, FFmpeg  
* **Cloud Services**: AWS S3, AWS EC2, AWS Lambda, AWS DynamoDB/RDS
